Your microphone is working now.  \\n \\n \\nHon.  Ndindi  Nyoro  (Kiharu,  UDA):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  for  this \\nopportunity.  This  House  is  very  anxious,  and  our  country  is  paralysed  in  so  far  as  the \\ndetermination of the majority and minority sides in this House is concerned. The Speaker had \\nindicated that this House was expecting a Communication from the Chair so that we determine \\nthe  majority  and  minority  sides.  This  will  allow  us  to  continue  with  the  very  business  that \\nbrought us to this House.  \\n\\nI seek your guidance because the country cannot continue to wait in paralysis and this \\n\\nI seek your communication. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, hold your horses. We still have until 8.00 p.m. \\n\\nHouse cannot continue to wait in anxiety.  \\n \\n \\nThe session is not yet over.  \\n \\n\\n \\nNow, I will call upon the Member for… \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\nProceed now that you are on your feet. \\nHon. Junet Mohamed (Suna East, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. We stand \\nguided as per your communication. As you are aware, this is a House of record and procedure. \\nThe last communication that we heard from the substantive Speaker was that he would deliver \\na ruling on the issue of the majority and minority sides on Thursday, 6th October 2022 at 2.30 \\np.m.  It  is  in  the  Hansard.  The  Hansard  will  bear  me  witness  that  the  Speaker  pronounced \\nhimself on the Floor of the House that he would deliver his ruling at 2.30 p.m. It is now 2.44 \\np.m. We are late by 14 minutes. Maybe the ruling is not ready, or the law has taken its course \\nand wisdom has befallen the leadership of the House and they have realised that the Azimio la \\nUmoja-One Kenya Alliance is the majority side, so that we move forward. We need to move \\nthe country forward as my colleague, the Kiharu Member of Parliament (MP), alluded to. We \\nshould not keep the country paralysed nor Parliament in anxiety.   \\n\\nThe rule of law is very  clear, as lawyers say. The law is very clear. There are many \\nlawyers in this House, some of who are Senior Counsels. I think Hon. Murugara is here. The \\nlawyers are here. The law is very clear. So, can we authoritatively say that the decision has \\nbeen made in silence that the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Alliance is the majority party in the \\nHouse, we move forward and conduct business as it is known in Parliament?   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  Hon.  Member,  you  are  out  of  order.  You  have  no  power  or \\nauthority to make a ruling on that point. The Hon. Speaker clearly communicated that he would \\ngive his ruling during this session that starts at 2.30 p.m. and ends at 8.00 p.m. Until we get to \\n8.00 p.m., we still have time. \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n  \\nOrder, Hon. Members! We will proceed with the debate. I have put that issue to a close. \\n\\nWe will now proceed to continue with the debate. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It is your turn.  \\nHon. Phelix Odiwour (Lang’ata, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. First of \\nall, let me take this opportunity to congratulate you for having been elected the Deputy Speaker \\nof this House. I also take this opportunity to thank the people of Lang’ata for giving me the \\nchance to represent them in this august House. I thank Team Jalas that put up a very big battle. \\nThe battle for Lang’ata was not an easy one. I take this opportunity to also thank my party, the \\nOrange  Democratic  Movement  (ODM),  and  my  party  leader,  Raila  Amolo  Odinga,  who \\nsupported me all the way to the end. I thank the teams from Mugumoini, Highrise, South C, \\nNairobi West, and Karen Wards. Most of the Members here are my constituents. Thank you \\nfor  your support. I take this opportunity to, again, thank my family that was with me in the \\nbattle.  \\n\\nI picked one thing in the President’s Speech that is very key for my constituency, which \\nis affordable housing. I am happy that the President is coming to  Lang’ata this week for the \\nlaunch of 4,500 houses in Zone B of Nyayo Highrise. I take this opportunity to tell the people \\nof Lang’ata to be ready. This project has taken long but it will finally come to fruition.  \\n\\nSecondly, I would like to talk about the Hustler Fund. I would like the fund to be given \\nto the Members of this House to care and be in charge of it. We campaigned with the hustlers \\nand we know them better than anyone else. We were with them.  \\n\\nI also want to talk about the savings that the President talked about. If the Hustler Fund \\nis coming, let the savings also be directed to the hustlers themselves so that they receive and \\nsave them on their own. Let them not be given to anybody else.  \\n\\nFor Lang’ata, I want to talk about stalled projects. We have a case in South C Market \\nwhere the land has already been allocated. They are just waiting for a few confirmations and \\napprovals  from  the county  government.  I request  the county  government  to  expedite this  so \\nthat work in that market can begin in earnest. I also thank the team that has been pushing for \\nMugumoini Market to start operating. Chairman Alois, I know you are watching. You asked \\nme to push for this market. The lawyers who are here, help us push for this market so that the \\nsmall battles we have in court can come to an end. We want this over and done with.  \\n \\nI  take  this  opportunity  to  tell  the  people  of  Lang’ata  that  the  issue  of  water  will  be \\naddressed.  Anytime  one  mentions  Lang’ata  everybody  talks  about  water.  The  Northern \\nCorridor Grid is already being worked on. We hope the water issue will finally end during this \\nterm  and  my  regime  as  the  Member  of  Parliament  for  Lang’ata.  That  is  when  the  Northern \\nCorridor infrastructure is completed and we are gridded into it. \\n \\nruling that Azimio is the Majority in this House. That is when he comes here later.  \\n\\nFinally,  I ask the Hon. Speaker to, in his wisdom and wherever he is, make the best \\n\\nThank you so much, Hon. Deputy Speaker.  \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\n \\nI  donate  the  remainder  of  my  time  to  Hon.  Salasya.  He  had  requested  me  to  donate \\nsome two minutes to him. He had something he wanted to say. Hon. Salasya is here. Thank \\nyou. \\n \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  No.  You  are  out  of  order.  I  now  call  upon  the  Member  for \\n\\n \\nKigumo. \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Joseph Munyoro (Kigumo, UDA): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. My name \\n \\nis  Joseph  Kamau  Munyoro  from  Kigumo  Constituency.  I  take  this  opportunity  to,  first, \\ncongratulate  the  Hon.  Speaker,  Moses  Wetang’ula  and  you,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  on  your \\nelection  as  the  Deputy  Speaker.  I  also  congratulate  our  President,  His  Excellency  William \\nSamoei Ruto and the Deputy President, Rigathi Gachagua on their election. \\n\\nSecondly, I thank the people of Kigumo for giving me this opportunity to serve them \\nas  their  representative  in  this  13th  Parliament.  People  from  Kahumbu,  Muthithi,  Kigumo, \\nKinyona  and  Kangari  Wards,  I  thank  you.  I  promise  you  that  I  do  not  take  for  granted  the \\nelection we conducted and you giving me the votes overwhelmingly. I will endeavour to serve \\nyou. I assure you that I will keep all the promises I made. I also take this opportunity to thank \\nmy family, my dear wife and children for the support they gave me during the campaigns. I \\nthank  my  extended  family  too  and  my  brothers  and  sisters,  and  my  mother  in  Mareira,  for \\ngiving the support that was required during the campaigns, for me to get to this Parliament. I \\nassure them that our family name is in safe hands. \\nI would like to tell the people of Kigumo that we have projects that we are following \\n \\nup. We have Kangari Market that, we know, is halfway done. I assure them that we will be \\nlooking at it and making sure that it is completed. We are launching Muthithi Market. We will \\ndo ground breaking next week. I assure them that we will ensure that all the projects we have \\nin the constituency are completed during my term. I also assure them that we have spoken about \\nbursaries and the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF). I thank \\nthe President for mentioning it here and assuring us that we will have the kitty to enable us \\neducate our children. We know that many of them are at home and some of these children can \\nonly be helped by paying their school fees from the kitty. We assure them that we will do that \\nwithout favour, and it will get to the needy people. \\n \\nTo comment on the President’s Speech, one of the things that really touched us as the \\npeople of Kigumo is on agriculture. We come from an agricultural constituency. We have tea \\nand coffee, and we do dairy farming and horticulture. Many of us are touched by farming. So, \\nthe issue of fertiliser subsidy has really helped. That is money directly put into people’s pockets \\nthrough the President’s Order to have the cost of fertiliser reduced. I saw the President meeting \\nwith the Tea Board of Kenya yesterday. I request him that we also look at the market. As we \\nget the farmers, especially of tea, let us do away with the cartels that control the prices. Since \\nhe has decided that we should go with one brand that is Kenyan and stop having blends, I ask \\nhim to look at having a better market for our tea farmers so that we can put more money into \\ntheir pockets. \\n \\nI thank the President too for mentioning the Hustler Fund. We are waiting for the kitty \\nbecause our  young men and women are at home and most of them are jobless. They do not \\nhave  capital  to  start  and  run  their  businesses  to  enable  them  feed  their  children.  He  also \\nmentioned the issue of water. Water is one of our real problems, especially in the lower areas \\nof  our  constituency.  We  would  like  to  be  involved  as  much  as  possible  because  if  we  are \\nincreasing the water supply from 60 per cent to 80 per cent, the constituencies that suffer most \\nshould be at the frontline. The lower area of Kigumo, especially Kahumbu, parts of Muthithi \\nand areas of Kangare need support and water made available.  \\n \\nthat they can start their businesses even in the Jua Kali sector and run them for income. \\n\\nThe President mentioned electricity. We want to  connect our people  to  electricity so \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I will also mention the issue of interest rates, and especially the \\nFuliza issue. We know that many of our people have those loans on their phones. Some of them \\ncannot transact using M-Pesa due to these loans. The lowering of the interest rates is really a \\ngood thing for us. I hope they will be lowered even further because even the 50 per cent is still \\nhigh.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c6th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                   5 \\n\\n \\nThe  President  raised  the  issue  of  the  Cabinet  Secretaries  coming  into  the  House  of \\n \\nParliament so that they are asked Questions. We have the Mau Road that is being constructed \\nand we have had issues with it. This is because it traverses more than one constituency. It would \\nbe fair for the Cabinet Secretary to answer one Question instead of each Member of Parliament \\nasking a Question to the Cabinet Secretary on their own, and them having to prepare an Answer \\nfor each one of us. That should be supported. On any legal framework that will come into this \\nHouse for us to actualise, I assure the President of our support.  \\nI will finish by saying that, coming from an agricultural constituency, we will still need \\n \\nmore to be done for our agriculture. There is market for our Hass avocadoes. We need to be \\nassured  because  we  have  somewhat  of  a  cartel  in  the  avocado  industry.  That  is  so  that \\neverybody sells their avocadoes directly without having to go through brokers hence making \\nmore money. \\n\\nAny legislation that will come into this House aims at supporting and actualising the \\npromises made by the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Government and our President. So \\nlong as it is serving our people, they can count on my support. I also assure our Kigumo people \\nthat their interests of being represented will be well done. On legislative functions, I will make \\nsure that laws passed here also support and favour us. I assure them that we shall oversee the \\nGovernment.  \\nI thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Thank you. Member for Dagoretti South. \\n \\n \\nHon. John Kiarie (Dagoretti South, UDA): Hon. Deputy Speaker, I take this very early \\nopportunity to, first, congratulate you. You are legendary. You are one of the few Kenyans I \\nknow who have served in all the three Arms of the Government. We saw you do some amazing \\nwork in the Executive. We know you did some great leadership in the Judiciary and you are \\nnow in the legislative Arm of Government as the Deputy Speaker. I take this opportunity on \\nbehalf of the people of Dagoretti South to profusely congratulate you on ascending to the very \\nhigh office of Deputy Speaker of this House. In the same breath, I congratulate the Rt. Hon. \\nMoses Wetang’ula on being elected overwhelming as the Speaker of the 13th Parliament. This \\nis my first address in this House on a substantive issue. So, I take this opportunity to thank the \\npeople of Dagoretti South Constituency, who decided that kweli it is time for us to get back to \\nBunge and do that which we had started in the last term.   \\n\\nOn the speech by the President, I want to concretise it into thematic areas. I was able to \\nnote that the speech by the President was succinct. It was short, sweet and to the point and after \\nall was said and done, out of the many paragraphs, one is able to summarise it into seven very \\nprofound thematic areas. His Excellency, the President was able to speak on agriculture and \\nfood security and the grand plan. He not only spoke about it but he has already sanctioned it \\nthrough  executive  action  because  we  saw  him  moving  our  subsidies  from  consumption  to \\nproduction. On that alone, I commend His Excellency, the President.   \\n\\nThis is a man who was elected on the back of a wave of a campaign that was driven by \\nthe hustlers of this country. The President was careful to recognise that there is a sector called \\nthe  Small  and  Micro  Enterprises  (SMEs)  and  to  it,  he  spoke  elaborately  about  the  plan  of \\ninvesting in this very critical sector. Of importance to me is the fact that this House has a role \\nto play in connecting the drive on SMEs with the Technical and Vocational Education Training \\ninstitutions (TVETs) and the installation of institutions that will be used for incubation and for \\napprenticeship for the people in the SMEs. \\n\\nFor  people  like  us  who  represent  urban  constituencies,  we  took  note  of  the  great \\ninvestment  in  the  Hustler  Fund  and  the  Enterprise  Fund,  which  we  know  is  going  to  spur \\ndevelopment  in  this  area.  I  pride  myself  as  the  “women  representative”  of  the  people  of \\nDagoretti South Constituency. I am a feminist and admittedly so, so I was very excited when \\nHis Excellency the President took up the women agenda. We know what the plans are and we \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c6th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                   6 \\n\\n \\nsaw  them  when  he  signed  charters  with  the  women  of  this  country.  Not  only  did  he  sign  a \\ncharter but he also transformed it into an agenda in his manifesto, which ended up becoming \\nthe Kenya Kwanza Plan that we shall be implementing. I commit as a feminist and the “women \\nrepresentative” of the people of Dagoretti South to support any legislative agenda that will push \\nthe women agenda in this House. \\n\\nHis  Excellency  the  President  was  keen  to  bring  up  the  health  agenda.  When  each \\nMember of Parliament here does their clinics on Monday mornings, the biggest issue they have \\nto contend with is how to pay hospital bills and bills for the deceased.  This  country cannot \\nafford  to  continue  paying  for  health  out  of  pocket.  When  his  Excellency  the  President  will \\nchampion Bills to reform the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) in this House, I shall \\nbe  a  champion.  I  will  champion  for  the  reform  of  the  health  sector,  and  more  so  health \\nfinancing. I commend the President for putting it in his speech. \\n\\nWe have been told that there is a taskforce coming up to review the Competency Based \\nCurriculum (CBC).  So, when it came up as an agenda on the President’s Speech, I was excited \\nbecause some of us have children in Grade Six this year. We want to know what CBC means \\nfor a young child of 12 years taken to a high school and has to be in school with students who \\nare probably 18 or 19 years. So, when we shall come to the issue of education, I know even \\nthis House shall be involved in recommending some changes to CBC form of education and \\nthis taskforce will be one of the things that will be a highlight in the life of this Parliament.   \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  His  Excellency  the  President  applied  himself  on  the  issue  of \\nInformation Communication Technology (ICT) and the digital economy.  This is a sector that \\nbrought me up. I would like to report to this House that in the world that we are living today, \\nideas and data are the currency.  If we do not take note of the new and emerging economies in \\nthe digital and creative economy, we shall not be fit for any purpose in a time such as this.  So, \\nit  is  my  joy  and  celebration  that  His  Excellency  the  President,  through  his  very  important \\nspeech, was able to address the issues of the creative digital economy.   \\n\\nThe question on whether telcos should continue operating as banks, whether they can \\nbe regulatable when they operate by the Communications Authority of Kenya while they are \\nalso conducting monetary business that should be overseen and regulated by the Central Bank \\nof Kenya (CBK) is an issue of concern. The issue of Fuliza and digital loans is critical. We \\ncannot have a country that is listed as people who cannot pay loans. The idea of moving the \\nCredit  Reference  Bureau  (CRB)  to  a  credit  system  was  very  welcome  as  an  idea  from  His \\nExcellency the President. I know this House shall have a bite on this issue. I know that our \\nMembers who represent Kenyans and have been listed, and who have been condemned shall \\nbe contributing to it. \\n\\nFor me, the housing issue is critical. I hail from this city that brought me up. I do not \\nknow of any other place. As people retreat to their rural areas, Nairobi is my ushago so to say.  \\nSo, when the issue of housing and settlement was brought up by His Excellency the President, \\nI was keen to know what he had to say. I picked out a great idea of aggregation, specialisation \\nand standardisation that speaks to the people of Dagoretti South, who are worldly renowned as \\nartisans and as Jua Kali Sector idea leaders. Hon. Deputy Speaker, if you drive on your way \\nfrom Adams Arcade round-about all the way to Karen, you shall see the street lined-up on both \\nsides of the road by Jua Kali artisans. These are people who will benefit from the housing and \\nsettlement plan.   \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, because there is no much time to lay out everything I wanted to \\nsay, I would leave it at the issue of corruption.  Hon.  Fatuma Mohammed from Migori County \\nsaid that His Excellency the President had nothing to say about corruption. That speech was \\nladen with issues if addressed would address the main issue of corruption. Even as we address \\ncorruption,  we  need  to  remind  ourselves  what  Mother  Theresa  told  us  –  that,  whatever  you \\nresist, persists. We cannot keep glorifying corruption by giving it a high pedestal. Let us start \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Let us make institutions that are titled with the word integrity and let \\nus stop glorifying corruption as a name. The more we glorify it, the more it persists. It is upon \\nus to align ourselves with integrity, ethics and morals but not to keep glorifying corruption. \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I thank you for giving me this opportunity. I take this chance to \\ncongratulate each and every Member of Parliament who was elected and I wish you a good… \\nHon. Deputy Speaker:  Thank you Member for Dagoretti South for your kind words.  \\n\\nI would now call the Member for Suna West.  \\n\\nHon. Peter Masara (Suna West): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker for giving me this \\n\\nopportunity to contribute in this House. \\n\\n First, I congratulate you for being elected the Deputy Speaker of the 13th Parliament. \\nBefore I say something about today’s agenda, let me thank the great people of Suna West for \\nelecting me for the second time to represent them in this very important House.  \\n\\nI thank the  youth,  religious leaders, professionals, business  community and all those \\nwho worked 24 hours to ensure that my second victory is one which I am not taken to court to \\nbe challenged.  \\n\\nAs I continue to contribute to today’s Motion, there are several areas I want to mention, \\nmore  particularly  on  the  youths.  We  are  talking  about  the  Hustler  Fund  according  to  the \\nPresident’s Speech. Some hustlers are old men and women, and the youths. I however want to \\nparticularly put emphasis on the issue of the youths of this country. Many were promised that \\nthere would be pesa mfukoni while some were to be given Kshs6,000 every month. All of them \\nare, however, now lamenting. If you read the Bible, the Book of Habakkuk, they do not know \\nif there is money in their pockets or at the end of the month they are going to get the promised \\nKshs6,000. Can we not formulate a policy to have a youth commission that will ensure that \\nsmall and medium enterprises money is given to the youth? This is because they do not have \\nenterprise startup capital. As we move forward and discuss the President’s Speech, we should \\nalso put emphasis on the issues of youths so that they can be part and parcel of this country.  \\n\\nI agree with what the President said on the Universal Health Coverage. We want to try \\nand  increase  the  number  of  people  being  covered  by  the  National  Hospital  Insurance  Fund \\n(NHIF). However, let us also consider the standards of health facilities in this country. We have \\nvery few referral hospitals in this country. If we do not increase their numbers to enable every \\ncounty to have a well-equipped hospital, we will continue losing our citizens simply because \\nthey cannot access standardized health services. On the same note, we may talk of Universal \\nHealth Coverage but what about the health workers? Do they have good representation? As we \\ntalk,  the  47  counties  are  not  able  to  manage  our  health  workers  well.  This  House  should, \\ntherefore,  consider  forming  a health commission  so that they  can deal  with  issues of health \\nworkers in this country.  \\n\\nOn the same note, I want to talk about infrastructure. The President did not cover this \\nin his Speech. The people of Suna West were expecting a lot in terms of infrastructure. We \\nhave a major road in Suna West called Kababu-Piny Oyie-Adera Road which is still unusable.  \\nWe expected a lot of money to be allocated to infrastructure so that we can benefit to enable us \\nmake this road to bitumen standard.  \\n\\nWe have civil servants in this country and as we all know, the cost of living is so high \\nwhile  salaries  remain  the  same.  We  need  to  look  into  our  civil  servants,  and  our  men  and \\nwomen in uniform when we discuss economy issues. This is because in their circumstances, \\nvery few people think about them.  \\n\\nOur  education  system  is  confusing.  Let  us  formulate  policies  which  can  guarantee \\nstandardized education. Today, even the professionals are not sure of what is going to happen \\ntomorrow. January is just next door but we do not know the system we will use. Above all, the \\nGovernment  has  tried  over  a  period  of  time  on  the  issues  of  free  secondary  education.  The \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Something has to be done about it.  \\n\\nWe also need to do something on the price of unga. Currently, it is trading at Kshs200 \\nplus. School principals are buying maize from the same market but the capitation allocation, \\nwhich was done 10 years ago, still remains constant. Are we doing favour and justice to these \\nschools  and  students  or  we  are  losing  it?  As  legislators,  I  believe  we  can  do  something  to \\nsalvage this country.  \\n\\nI want to talk about the KRA issue that was mentioned world over. I have been doing \\nsome small research world over and there is no friendly tax collector.  A tax collector is always \\none. The best thing that can be done is to come up with good  policies where those who are \\npaying tax can see or feel value for it; and by doing so, nobody will complain about it. We need \\nto see good roads, hospitals and salary increments.  \\n\\nOn the issue of security, what are we doing for our people who are not secured? Are we \\nincreasing the number of vehicles for police officers? Are we increasing the salaries for men \\nand women in uniform? Are we jailing criminals or letting them go scot-free? Our courts should \\ndo something about the people responsible for insecurity in this country.  \\n\\nFinally, I congratulate each and every Member of this 13th Parliament for being elected. \\nI remind them that as we are now being celebrated, we will become the enemies of the public \\nthe  next  day  if  we  do  not  meet  their  expectations.  We  need  to  do  things  which  we  will  be \\nremembered for, whether in this House or out there. We must develop our people to an extent \\nthat even when you are no longer in Parliament, people talk about you. That way, people will \\nremember you many years after you exit the position of leadership.  \\n\\nI thank my ODM party and my leader Hon. Rt. Raila Amollo Odinga for giving me an \\nopportunity to serve the people of Suna West as an elected Member through his party. The last \\ntime I was in this House as an Independent Member of Parliament, I faced so many challenges. \\nI pray that the current Independent Members do not face the same. We need to strengthen our \\nparties  so  that  democracy  can  prevail  in  this  country.  We  need  people  like  Hon.  Rt.  Raila \\nAmollo Odinga to be respected and given opportunity as the few statesmen we have in Africa \\ntoday.  \\n\\nAs we are about to talk about Azimio la Umoja and Kenya Kwanza, we must know that \\nthere are people who contributed to the liberation we are enjoying today. Sometime back, there \\nwere areas which could not develop themselves because there was no devolution. Some people \\ndied because of fighting for devolution. If I recall, someone like Dr. Odhiambo Mbai was killed \\nbecause he was agitating and fighting for the people of Kenya to be liberated for the second \\ntime.  \\n\\nNobody  was mentioned  as a candidate for  the Ministry of Devolution  and Planning. \\nThat worries me because I was the last Mayor of Migori, and I know what devolution can do. \\nSomething, therefore, needs to be done so that we have a powerful Minister to head the Ministry \\nof  Devolution  and  Planning  so  that  we  can  strengthen  our  devolved  units  for  people  to  get \\nservices irrespective of whether they are in or out of Government.  \\n\\nThank you for giving me the opportunity. \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker:  What  is  your  point  of  order,  Hon.  Member  for  Eldas?  I  am \\n\\nsorry Members; it is not a point of order. You can go ahead and contribute. \\n\\nHon. Adan Keynan (Eldas, JP): Thank you for giving me an opportunity to contribute \\n\\nto this important debate.  \\n\\nI take this opportunity to congratulate you for being among the few lady representatives \\nfor the 13th Parliament. I also congratulate all Members here for having been elected to the 13th \\nParliament.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, an elective position is the most difficult and sometimes the most \\nsought-after job. This is why I welcome my colleagues to the 13th Parliament. Enjoy both the \\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I am sure in due course you will realise that there are \\ncertain things that we must not take for granted.  \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, before I go back to the President’s Speech, I would like to thank \\nthe people of Wajir West. I know we have our able Member Hon. Muliro Farah – Hon. Yusuf \\nFarah – that was my first constituency that showed me the door to politics. I was a Member of \\nParliament twice, elected actually for 10 years then later on I moved to Eldas where I am doing \\nmy fifth term as a representative of the people of Eldas.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I must appreciate that at one time the current Head of State and \\nI  were  classified  as  young  legislators  who  benefitted  from  a  programme  called  The  Young \\nLegislators Programme sponsored by the United States of America (USA) Embassy. We went \\naround  globe-trotting  to  enjoy  the  benefits  of  being  newly  elected  young  Members  of \\nParliament. That was in 1998. We went to the USA where we visited over 18 States and that \\nProgramme opened the doors for us.  \\n \\nOne thing that I appreciate and felt very good about this particular speech is respect for \\nthe  separation  of  institutional  roles.  Those  of  us  who  were  there  and  participated  in  the \\nmidwifing  of  the  current  Constitution,  one  of  the  things  that  the  August  2010  Constitution \\nemphasised on is respect for the rule of law.  \\n\\nHon. Deputy Speaker, you are a lawyer with many years of experience.  The opening \\nchapter  in  Article  1  emphasizes  on  representation  and  clearly  spells  out  the  nexus  between \\nrepresentation and sovereignty. That is one Article that all of us must accept and pursue to the \\nletter.  At  times  somebody  will  invoke  Articles  95  and  96  and  say  the  role  of  a  Member  of \\nParliament  (MP)  is  not  clearly  defined.  Unfortunately,  the  Salaries  and  Remuneration \\nCommission (SRC) up to now is yet to accept the role of Members of Parliament. It is not just \\nlimited to representation.  \\n \\nAn MP is an embodiment of everything in the Kenyan society. That is why Hon. Deputy \\nSpeaker, the best diplomats or economic advisors are found amongst Members of Parliament. \\nKenya  is  a  premier  nation.  One  of  the  things  that  the  President’s  Speech  emphasized  was \\ndevelopment of different sectors: the economic, security, infrastructural and education sectors. \\nAll these require an informed, knowledgeable and persistent Member of Parliament through \\nlegislation  and  oversight.  That  is  why  without  the  National  Government  Constituencies \\nDevelopment Fund (NG-CDF), there would be no representation. I will ask my colleagues here \\nto agree with me that “No NG-CDF, no representation.” This is because without it, there would \\nbe no need of being an MP. In the 1990s, when there was no NG-CDF, MPs were miserable. \\nThe presence of the NG-CDF has given life, human dignity and taste to representation.  \\n \\nWhatever  you do, regardless of the differences in our political  persuasions, the NG-\\nCDF must remain an integral part of our day-to-day activities. That is why I appreciated when \\nHis Excellency the President talked about retention of the NG-CDF. For that to happen, it is \\nup to all of us to pursue it to the letter. Otherwise, dictates from the Treasury mandarins will \\nalways be there and they are loyal to their own interests. For us, our loyalty is to those who \\nbrought us to this House. That is a very important ingredient in your life.  \\n\\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  coming  back  to  Kenya,  just  some  few  days  before  the  final \\nresults were announced, the atmosphere was pregnant with so many rumours and speculations. \\nThe people were speculating on what might happen. There were trivial advices and so many \\nother challenges. However, one thing that we must appreciate is the resilience of the Kenyan \\npeople  and  the  maturity  of  our  democracy.  Kenya  is  not  just  a  country  by  name  but  it  is  a \\npremier republic. Today  in  Ethiopia, an eventful  day is happening because of the  effects  of \\nSafaricom diplomacy which is being felt in the entire Africa. We are going to be very proud of \\nthat event because soon the benefits of Safaricom are going to be felt all over.  \\n \\nEqually,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  Kenya  is  an  economic,  security  and  diplomatic  hub. \\nThese are things we must appreciate as citizens and representatives of the people. The other \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

What we need to benefit from \\nthis  is  our  diaspora  diplomacy.  I  know  very  soon  there  will  be  an  inclusion  of  diaspora \\ndiplomacy as one of the tenets of our foreign policy but before that is domesticated, the diaspora \\ndiplomacy has greatly contributed and improved our economy. That is something that each one \\nof us here as Parliamentarians and part of parliamentary diplomacy must be prepared to engage \\nin. In this era of representation, Parliamentarians are the best diplomats in other jurisdictions \\nand  democracies.  However,  in  the  Kenyan  context,  the  Parliamentarian  is  not  regarded  as \\nsomebody who is well informed. This is because of the basic definitions that other people were \\nnot friendly to Parliament previously and the same was projected to the Members of Parliament. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, there is the issue of drought, which His Excellency the President \\nhas alluded to. However, my colleagues from Northern Kenya must accept that the era of food \\nrelief must come to an end. Instead, we need to pursue water availability and irrigation, revival \\nof  Kenya  Meat  Commission  (KMC)  and  Kenya  Livestock  Marketing  Authority  (KLMA). \\nThese things have died over the years. In 1968, Kenya was a leading beef exporter to the whole \\nworld. Today we get our beef from Botswana. In 1968, Kenya was a leading donor nation. In \\nfact, our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was at par with that of South Korea. Today, South \\nKorea’s GDP is five times that of Kenya and yet they have no known natural resource. These \\nare issues we must deal with and address as citizens of the Republic of Kenya.  \\nFinally,  Hon.  Deputy  Speaker,  we  are  approaching  a  very  difficult  time  because  of \\n \\nserious  rise  in  inflation,  economic  stagnation  and  unemployment.  These  are  issues  we  can \\nsalvage if we put our heads together. We are surrounded by countries that have had serious \\nsecurity  challenges  and  that  is  why  Kenya  remains  a  very  important  component  of  the \\ninternational  community.  That  is  why  I  believe  in  their  own  wisdom,  the  international \\ncommunity decided to elect Kenya as a member of the United Nations Security Council. That \\nis  not  just  a  mere  achievement.  It  is  a  serious  achievement  which  we  must  be  prepared  to \\njealously protect.  \\n \\nHon.  Deputy  Speaker,  this  is  just  the  beginning  of  this  Session.  Eventually,  we  will \\nbegin  to  learn  and  appreciate  each  other.  However,  my  final  word  today  on  this  is  that  as \\nMembers of the 13th Parliament, we are one family. Regardless of our political persuasions, we \\nare one family and outside there, we will be treated as Members of one family. Whatever we \\ndo, let us engage soberly and with dignity while appreciating our roles. There is a time I was \\nthe  youngest  Member  here.  Today,  I  am  among  the  oldest  Members  of  Parliament.  Time \\nchanges.  These  are  realities  that  we  must  expect  and  appreciate;  that  my  contribution  and \\nexperience will add value to you. Also, your coming in will add value to me. Ultimately, we \\nhave the best representation in the 13th Parliament.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Member for Garissa County. \\n \\n \\nHon. Amina Siyad (Garissa CWR, JP): Thank you Hon. Deputy Speaker. My name is \\nAmina Udgoon, the Woman Representative of Garissa County. First and foremost, I would like \\nto thank the people of Garissa County for voting me in. I am a desert flower, a young lady and \\na humanitarian before I became a politician. Thank you. congratulations for being elected as \\nthe Hon. Deputy Speaker. As a woman, I am proud of you.  \\n\\nAbout the speech of the President, it was short, concise and to the point. It is largely \\npeople-centred  and  it  is  about  Wanjiku.  It  reflected  the  aspirations  of  the  new  President  in \\ncharge of the lives of the ordinary citizens. However, there were notable gaps. A million plus \\ncitizens in more than 23 counties are being affected by drought. More so the people of Garissa \\nCounty and the larger Northern Kenya are staring at starvation. Mothers and children are the \\nworst affected, especially lactating mothers and infants.  \\n\\nThe President’s Speech  ought  to  have largely  centred on this recurring problem  that \\naffects the people of Northern Kenya every year. The situation is grim, horrific and desperate. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Some things need to be done to save the lives \\nof millions of people. I expected His Excellency the President to touch on these serious issues \\nsince he was addressing us as the peoples’ representatives. Under our Constitution, the State is \\nresponsible for the lives of all Kenyans. Efforts must be made to ensure that no Kenyans lose \\ntheir lives because of hunger. I  must  commend  the  Government  for  the  little  but  necessary \\neffort it has initiated by sending relief food to the affected people. However, more needs to be \\ndone. I thank His Excellency the Deputy President, Rigathi Gachagua aka Riggy-G for leading \\nthis exercise. We hope the new Cabinet will address this issue. \\n \\nAnother important issue His Excellency the President forgot is the good message of \\nunity in our country. He is no doubt the President of 50 plus million Kenyans; those who voted \\nfor him and those who did not. Without commitment to the unity of the nation, the Government \\nmight not succeed in its endeavours. The unity of our people is paramount. The President is a \\nsymbol of national unity under our Constitution.

Deputy  Speaker:  Thank  you,  Member  for  Garissa  County  for  being  brief. \\n \\nMembers, I think the reason why we had the Procedural Motion on limitation of debate was to \\nensure that as many Members as possible have an opportunity to speak, particularly those who \\nare making their maiden speeches.  I can see there are people who have already spoken, but \\ntheir names are appearing. Kindly pull out your cards. I have a very good memory, in case you \\nthought I have forgotten. For example, the Member for Emurua Dikirr, I can see your name \\nhere and you have already spoken. Member for Kigumo, also remove your card. I will find out.  \\nI now call the Member for Elgeyo Marakwet County, please, proceed. \\n \\n \\nHon. Caroline Ng’elechei (Elgeyo Marakwet CWR, Independent): Thank you, Hon. \\nDeputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to make my maiden speech. First and foremost, \\nI  thank  God  and  the  people  of  Elgeyo  Marakwet  for  electing  me  to  this  august  House.  My \\njourney here was not easy. I come from Elgeyo Marakwet County, which is the ‘bedroom’ of \\nthe United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Party. But the people believed in me and voted for me \\noverwhelmingly, and I thank God for this and appreciate them. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, I come from a county with many challenges, and one sector that \\nis  facing  many  challenges  is  agriculture.  About  100  per  cent  of  the  residents  of  Elgeyo \\nMarakwet  are farmers who either keep domestic  animals,  or grow crops.  The issue that has \\nbeen affecting my people recently is that of fertiliser prices, and I applaud and commend the \\nPresident for talking about subsidising farming inputs. I believe that going forward, the life of \\na farmer will be as rosy as anybody who lives in the city; enjoying what comes from the farm \\nwithout knowing the hustle and bustle that farmers go through. \\n \\nI also want to assure the people of Elgeyo Marakwet that we will handle the issue of \\nbanditry in Kerio Valley. This is because they do not enjoy peace because others have taken \\nthe  law  into  their  hands,  and  walk  around  brandishing  firearms  the  way  they  want.  Going \\nforward, I believe that through this House, I will bring legislation to ensure that we can live \\nlike other people.  \\n \\nIt is about time that the issue of banditry in Kerio Valley was categorised as terrorism.  \\nThis is because a bandit is more than a terrorist. If you can remember in the last year, some \\npeople were killed in Kerio Valley by people with illegal firearms in their hands. The number \\nof those killed was more than those killed by the Al Shabaab in the last five years. So, the Al \\nShabaab and bandits are all in the same category. Through this House, I will ensure that we \\ncategorise bandits as terrorists so that the issue of banditry can come to an end. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The previous Government massacred this exercise at the expense \\nof the benefit to the people. I will ensure those projects are revived, so that they can help the \\npeople to irrigate their farms. \\nAllow  me  to  thank  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  Kenya  for  remembering  mama \\n \\nmbogas and hustlers. In this country, the gap between the rich and poor is widening day and \\nnight.  This  is  because  the  poor  become  poorer  daily.  However,  through  the  Hustler  Fund,  I \\nbelieve that the people of Elgeyo Marakwet will benefit by using the revolving fund to improve \\ntheir lives. \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker, since I know there is a queue of so many people who want to \\ngive their maiden speeches, I wish to donate the extra time I have so that even my Member of \\nParliament (MP) for Marakwet West can have a chance to give his maiden speech.  \\nI appreciate and thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. \\n \\n \\nHon. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, if you come to side-talk me requesting for time \\nto  speak,  you  are  automatically  disqualified.  This  is  because  I  do  not  want  to  give  the \\nimpression that if you side-talk me, then you get an opportunity. So, if you come here, you are \\ndisqualified.  Let us have the Member for Nairobi County. If your card is not working, ask the \\nClerk-at-the-Table or the Serjeant-at-Arms to assist you. Let us have Hon. Passaris. \\nHon. Esther Passaris (Nairobi CWR, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. First \\n \\nand foremost, allow me to start by congratulating you for being elected as the Deputy Speaker \\nof  this  august  House.  I  also  want  to  congratulate  our  Speaker,  Hon.  Moses  Wetang’ula  for \\nbeing elected, and every Member of Parliament who has made it back. It is said that we had \\nthe highest number of returnees to this Parliament.  \\n \\nI also want to congratulate my worthy opponent, hon. Millicent Omanga, because we \\nhad  an  amazing  campaign  together.  We  did  not  tread  on  each  other’s  toes.  She  accepted, \\nconceded defeat and congratulated me. I think this is the kind of politics that we want.  \\n \\nI also want to congratulate the country, because it has grown in democracy. We had a \\npeaceful  election  and  there  were  many  people  who  were  hurt  by  this  election;  over  seven \\nmillion  people  but  we  stood  for  the  democracy,  which  is  the  respect  that  we  all  have.  The \\npeople  that  supported  Raila  Amolo  Odinga  and  the  Azimio  fraternity,  and  the  respect  for \\ndemocracy. I want to congratulate Kenyans for the peaceful election. We are a model for the \\nentire world. \\n \\nI also take this opportunity to thank the Nairobi voters; those who voted for me, those \\nwho did not vote for me, and those who did not  show up to vote. We understand that there \\nmight have been a lot of voter apathy, and it is something that we, as leaders, will strive to \\nwork for; and make you understand that voting is an important exercise. A total of 8 million \\npeople did not show up to vote, and that should be a concern to every elected leader.  \\n \\n Now  we  are  here  to  discuss  the  President’s  Speech.  While  we  are  looking  at  the \\nPresident’s Speech, I would like to first congratulate the President for being sworn in as the \\nPresident of this country. In this country after an election, we try to come together. Today as \\nwe sit and discuss the President’s Speech, he talked about and touched on a number of issues. \\nFor me, it is not about whether it was a long a speech or a short one. What I took back is the \\nfact  that  he  wanted  to  ensure  that  we  continue  the  programmes  that  we  had  in  the  12th \\nParliament like housing food security and infrastructure, among others. I believe that kind of \\ncontinuity is important. \\n\\nAs  a  women  representative,  when  I  came  into  office,  I  found  projects  that  my \\npredecessor  had  started  but  had  not  been  completed.  I  continued  with  them.  That  is  very \\nimportant. We recently accompanied the President as he was launching a housing project. That \\nis a project that started in the last administration, where he was the Deputy President. He wants \\nto continue with. I like the fact that he actually spoke to the point that the rental income will be \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Nairobi has a slum in every corner. The \\npeople of Nairobi want better housing. That was part of the four agendas of the Government, \\nand I believe that continuity of programs that are good will be very favourable for this country.  \\nThe area that I have a problem when it comes to food security is our rush for Genetically \\nModified Organisms (GMO). I believe that in the whole world, if you go to Europe right now, \\nthe  priciest  commodities  are  the  ones  that  are  organic.  When  we  start  thinking  of  GMOs,  I \\nbelieve that we should start treading slowly. As much as we want to feed our people, we have \\nto make sure that we understand that, as a country, we do not just want to feed ourselves but to \\nexport our products. We have to think twice and we have to educate our people. With the rising \\ncases of cancer, if we rush to GMOs, we might also end up having a situation where we are \\nincreasing  our  medical  costs  and  we  also  have  Universal  Health  Coverage  (UHC)  as  a  big \\nprogramme for this country. \\n\\nOn the idea of savings, the President said that when you retire, your National Social \\nSecurity Fund (NSSF) contributions will not be sufficient for you in retirement at the rate of \\nKshs200. He talked about Kshs2 and Ksh1 coming from the State. That is very good idea. But \\nat the same time, what we have to realise is that if we do not handle corruption, which is the \\nbig elephant in the room, then we will be faced with the situation where people are saving and \\nthe money is being siphoned out and not invested. I believe that when we save for retirement, \\none of the things that we should offer our citizens is affordable housing. We see a lot of citizens \\nthat have worked very hard, but they can hardly live on the retirement benefits that they get \\nfrom the Government.  \\n\\nWhen it comes to the borrowing that we have in this county, the President touched on \\nreducing the budget by over Kshs300 billion. The excess that we have to borrow every year of \\nKshs900 billion is reduced by Kshs300 billion. That is the good initiative but then, we have to \\nask ourselves where we are going to find that money. I believe that this country loses so much \\nmore than the Kshs300 billion to corruption. So, while we are strengthening our institutions, \\nlike the Judiciary, the Police Service and we are giving them budgets so that they can sustain \\nthemselves, we have to deal with corruption. \\n\\nAn  area  that  I  had  hoped  the  President  would  look  into  is  investment  and  investor \\nconfidence. This country right now makes it very difficult for people to invest and bring money \\ninto the country. You have a situation where if you want to deposit any money, the maximum \\nthat  you  are  allowed  to  deposit  is  USD10,000. Many  Kenyans  have  got  money  outside  this \\ncountry, and they cannot come and bring it. We desperately need that money to come into this \\ncountry. I believe that we should allow some kind of amnesty to bring in the money and remove \\nthe obstacle where you have to deposit only USD10,000, and provide sufficient documentation \\nfor it. The problem is that it is stifling many people who are coming into this country to make \\ninvestments.  I believe that not  every amount of  money that comes into this country of over \\nUSD10,000 could be stolen money. But we are making it very difficult for people to come into \\nthis country to invest because of the red tape that we have.  \\n\\nKenya is a blessed country, but we have a situation right now which is drought. We \\nneed an intervention from the Government. It is sad to see that right now, Kenyans do not have \\nfood. In so many parts of this country, children are dying of malnutrition because their parents \\ncannot afford to give them healthy nutritious food. People are dying because there is no food \\nin the country.  \\n\\nSo, while we talk about the fact that this country does not have enough food, I think the \\nmost  important  thing  that  we  have  to  address  as  a  country  is  also  family  planning.  At  the \\nmoment, we do not have enough family planning in this country. We do not buy commodities. \\nFamily planning is dependent on donors. Every country has to plan its population. In Kenya, \\nwe have failed to plan our population. In the 1960’s, when Tom Mboya was asked by the British \\nBroadcasting Corporation (BBC): “What programmes do you have for your country?” The first \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

It is really sad to see a \\nnumber of women having children, not because they want children, but because they did not \\nhave access to information on family planning. They did not have access to the commodities. \\nThose women have children and they are condemned to abject poverty. \\n\\n  \\n\\n[The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Gladys Boss) left the Chair) \\n\\n \\n\\n[The Speaker (Hon. Moses Wetang’ula) took the Chair] \\n\\n \\nI know we say that we are a Christian country, but I want you to understand that even \\nGod himself was a family planner. He believes in family planning. In the cycle of a woman, \\nthere is a period where she cannot have a child. As a country, we need to plan our population \\nso that we can actually look after our environment and also protect the citizens of this country \\nto be able to prosper.  \\n\\nThank you, Hon. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity.  \\nThe Hon. Speaker: Thank you. Member for Kandara, proceed.  \\nHon. Members: Ruling!  \\nHon. Speaker: After the Member for Kandara, you will get what you are asking for. \\nHon.  Alice  Wahome  (Kandara,  UDA):  Thank  you,  Hon.  Speaker.  I  take  this \\nopportunity to congratulate you on your election by this House as our Speaker. Having said \\nthat,  I  also  congratulate  your  Deputy,  Hon.  Gladys  Shollei,  for  being  elected  as  the  Deputy \\nSpeaker. May I then also go further to congratulate each and every Member of this House for \\na very hard job to ensure that they were elected to this House. I congratulate my colleagues, \\nthe  women  Hon.  Members  who  have  been  elected  from  the  29  constituencies.  Those \\nconstituencies  have  agreed  to  elect  women  MPs.  We  are  29  and  I  recognise  that  we  lost  8 \\nwomen by failure to retain their seats. In the last House, we were 23, and I was the Chairperson \\nof that caucus. We are now 29 women. We hope to retain and get an addition. We appreciate \\nthose constituencies that continue to elect women, and specifically my constituency, Kandara, \\nfor giving me a third honourable term. I will forever remain grateful. It is an unusual situation \\nfor a woman to be elected for three terms. Where I come from, we are still very conservative \\nand,  therefore,  Kandara  Constituency  has  demonstrated  progressive  thinking  and  action \\ntowards political development. Thank you.  \\n\\nI  also  want  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  His  Excellency  the  President  of  the \\nRepublic of Kenya, Dr.  William Samoei Ruto  for seeing it fit to  appoint me as the Cabinet \\nSecretary (CS) for the Ministry of Water, Sanitation and Irrigation, subject to the approval of \\nthis House. The approval is a very important process, and nobody should take this House for \\ngranted. Even though some of us have been appointed, I look forward to appearing before the \\nrelevant committee. Those who have said that they will approve my name, thank you. I will \\ntruly appreciate. \\n\\nLet me make my contribution on the Address by the President. I know that I may not \\nhave much time, if I am approved by this House. I am grateful for this opportunity to contribute \\nto the address by His Excellency. To the new Members who may not know me, my name is \\nAlice Muthoni Wahome, Member for Kandara Constituency. Kandara is in Murang’a County, \\nfor record purposes. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, I think it is important to read this Address. I know that we all listened to \\nthe Address by His Excellency the President. One key thread that has come out for me is this: \\nHe spoke about ensuring that he will run a Government that is transparent and accountable. \\nThe role of this House is to hold the Government to account. Therefore, for His Excellency to \\ncome out in his own address to uphold the House, and to continue to urge the House to ensure \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Speaker,  the  President  also  said  that  he  hopes  legislative  proposal  from  his \\nGovernment  will  receive  a  bipartisan  approach  in  a  bipartisan  debate,  noting  that  whatever \\nproposals are brought by the Government are proposals for the good and for the interest of the \\npeople  of  Kenya.  I,  therefore,  think  it  is  important  as  legislators  to  isolate  politics  from \\ndevelopment. We all agree that we can debate, we can disagree as we have done before; we in \\nfact even haggle and push, while noting that as legislators, we have a duty to ensure that the \\nGovernment  delivers  on  the  promises  that  it  has  made.  One  key  issue  is  the  promise  as  a \\ncoalition to  look  at  the economy  from  a bottom  up approach. Therefore,  we expect  that the \\nGovernment will continue to look at projects and programmes that will ensure that it lifts the \\npeople from the bottom upwards, while ensuring that where the economy is hurting most is \\naddressed as soon as possible. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, the address by the President also  speaks to reducing the borrowing in \\nthis country. The President, particularly seems to detest the fact that the country has found itself \\nborrowing to finance recurrent expenditure. No country can be proud if it is borrowing instead \\nof putting money into development, production and industrial development. We are borrowing \\nto meet our recurrent expenditure. I appreciate the fact that it has been picked up very early in \\nthis Government’s term.   \\n\\nI have also looked at something relevant to the portfolio that I have been appointed to, \\nwhich includes, ensuring that there is access to water coverage. Access to water is currently at \\n60  per  cent.  The  Government  hopes  that  we  can  push  it  to  80  per  cent.  We  target  to  raise \\nKshs500 billion shillings, as stated in his Address. I hope that it will be possible to work with \\nthe Public Private Partnerships (PPP) and investors to raise the money. If I am approved by this \\nHouse, my office will remain open to MPs. I will make sure that we continue to work for the \\nbenefit of the people. I know that if the relationship between the Legislature and the Executive \\nis improved and enhanced, and if we ensure that there is a logical prudent reasonable working \\nrelationship, we can make a difference. We can deliver to the people, noting that where we are \\nas a country, nobody is proud of the fact that the country is on its knees literally, and that we \\nall need to work very hard. \\n\\nHon. Speaker, I want to finalise by saying that the people of Kandara are fairly anxious. \\nI  know  that  they  expected  a  five-year  term  from  me,  having  elected  me  with  quite  a  good \\nnumber of votes. Since campaigns are ongoing, I am sure I will have an opportunity to seek \\nthe approval of my constituents to be able to move to the next office. I know that they would \\nhave wanted me to serve for another term. I do not take it for granted that they gave me that \\nterm. I will be consulting them. We shall be engaging even before I come to appear before the \\nrelevant committee.  \\n\\nThank you, hon. Members for listening to me. I am here until you get me out of here. \\nHon. Speaker: Thank you, honourable Member for Kandara. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMESSAGE \\n\\n \\n\\nNOMINATION OF PERSONS FOR APPOINTMENT TO THE CABINET \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Hon.

Members, in the Message, His Excellency the President also conveys that he has \\nnominated Hon. Justin  Bedan Njoka Muturi, EGH, as the Attorney-General  and Ms.  Mercy \\nWanjau as the Secretary to the Cabinet. His Excellency the President now seeks the approval \\nof the National Assembly on the nominees for appointment to the said offices.  \\n\\nAs you are all aware, the Committee on Appointments is yet to be constituted, despite \\nthe provisions of Standing Order No.204(2) requiring that the Committee be appointed within \\nseven  days  on  the  assembly  of  a  new  House.  This  has  been  occasioned  by  the  fact  that  the \\nHouse  Business  Committee  (HBC)  is  yet  to  be  formed,  on  account  of  the  question  of  the \\nleadership of the majority party and the minority party, which I will rule on after this. \\n\\nIt is the HBC which is charged with the responsibility of nominating Members to sit in \\nthe Committee on Appointments, save for the slots reserved for the leadership of the House. \\nHaving resolved the stalemate in a short time to come, we will then move to the next level to \\nprocess these appointments.   \\n\\nSection  8  of  the  Public  Appointments  (Parliamentary  Approval)  Act,  2012  provides \\nthat, unless otherwise provided in law, the committee to which such nomination is referred to \\nshall  consider  the  matter  and  table  a  report  in  the  House  within  28  days.  It  is,  therefore, \\nimperative  that  once  the  Committee  on  Appointments  is  formed,  it  should  immediately \\ncommence the process  of consideration of the nominees to  enable speedy conclusion of the \\nvetting process within the set timelines.  \\n\\nI also direct the Clerk of the National Assembly to take the necessary steps and notify \\nthe nominees and the general public through an advertisement in daily newspapers of national \\ncirculation; and on the parliamentary website, of the time and place of holding the approval \\nhearings. This should be done by Friday, 7th October 2022 following which the Committee on \\nAppointments should commence the approval hearings.  \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

In  accordance  with  the  law,  the  House  would  be  required  to  consider  the \\nCommittee’s  report  and  make  a  decision  on  the  nominees  within  seven  days  following  the \\ntabling of the report; that is on or before Thursday, 3rd November 2022.  \\n\\nThe House is accordingly guided. \\n\\n(Several Hon. Members stood at the entrance) \\n\\nCan the Members at the back take their seats?  \\nHon. Members, the following is a ruling on a matter that has been contested before the \\nHouse  and  in  correspondence  with  my  Office,  and  that  has  taken  centre-stage  in  the  public \\nmedia on the issue of the leadership of the National Assembly in the 13th Parliament.  \\n\\nHere I go. \\n \\n\\nCOMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR \\n\\n \\n\\nCONSIDERED RULING: LEADERSHIP OF THE NATIONAL \\n\\nASSEMBLY IN THE 13TH PARLIAMENT \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Members, you will recall that during the afternoon sitting of Tuesday, 4th October \\n2022, I informed the House that a question had arisen on the manner of constituting the House \\nBusiness Committee, especially with  regard to  the membership reserved for the leaders and \\nwhips of the majority party and the minority party, respectively. In guiding the House on the \\nbusiness to be transacted before the establishment of the House Business Committee and the \\nmanner in which the business would be moved, I indicated that a question had arisen as to who \\nthe bona fide leader of the majority party in the House is. I proceeded to allow the House to \\naddress me on this matter and gave priority to the designated Party Leaders and Whips of the \\nKenya Kwanza Coalition and the Azimio La Umoja - One Kenya Coalition Political Party.  \\n\\nIn the debate that ensued, Hon. Kimani Ichung’wah tabled various coalition agreements \\nentered into by the constituent parties of the Kenya Kwanza Coalition and deposited with the \\nRegistrar of Political Parties. Hon. Silvanus Osoro also tabled letters relating to the matter, an \\nexcerpt of the minutes of the parliamentary group meeting and a list of attendees of the meeting \\nduring which the Party Leaders were elected. \\n\\nSimilarly, Hon. Opiyo Wandayi tabled a copy of a letter dated 7th September 2022 from \\nthe  Registrar  of  Political  Parties  (RPP)  addressed  to  the  Clerk  of  the  National  Assembly, \\nconveying what the Registrar termed as constituent parties of the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya \\nCoalition Party, the Kenya Kwanza Alliance (KKA), the name of one party not affiliated to \\nany coalition and an indication of parties that had filed constitutional petitions and objections \\nto their membership of the Azimio Coalition. \\n\\nWhile contributing to the debate, Hon. Junet Mohamed also tabled what he claimed to \\nbe the coalition agreement entered into between the constituent parties of the Azimio la Umoja \\n- One Kenya Coalition Party. Several other Members also weighed in on the matter, including \\nMember  for  Garissa  Township,  Hon.  Aden  Duale;  nominated  Member  Hon.  John  Mbadi; \\nMember for Ugenya, Hon. David Ochieng’, Member for Tiaty, Hon. William Kamket; Member \\nfor  Kimilili,  Hon.  Didmus  Barasa;  Member  for  Kathiani,  Hon.  Robert  Mbui;  Member  for \\nAinabkoi, Hon.

Sarah  Korere;  Member  for  Ganze,  Hon.  Kenneth  Kazungu  Charo  and \\nMember for Alego Usonga, Hon. Samuel Atandi. \\n\\nOther  Members  who  spoke  on  the  matter  include  Member  for  Tinderet,  Hon.  Julius \\nMelly; Member for Kilifi North, Hon. Owen Baya; Member for Kabondo Kasipul, Hon. Eve \\nObara;  Member  for  Kangundo,  Hon.  Fabian  Muli;  Member  for  Dagoretti  South,  Hon,  John \\nKiarie; Member for Embakasi South, Hon. Julius Mawathe; Member for Kiminini, Hon.

At  the  conclusion  of  the \\ndebate, I reserved my considered ruling for today. There are many other Members who rose on \\npoints of order. I need not mention them. \\n\\nFrom the onset, Hon. Members, permit me to amplify a portion of the contribution made \\nby Hon. John Mbadi, which is key to the resolution of this matter. The Hansard records Hon. \\nMbadi as having said that: \\n\\n“There is no contention over which Members constitute the leadership of both \\nthe  Kenya  Kwanza  Coalition  and  the  Azimio  la  Umoja  -  One  Kenya  Coalition.  The \\nonly contention that exists (and which formed the basis of the debate that ensued) is \\nover which of the two is the majority.” \\nArticle 108 of the Constitution establishes the offices of party leaders in Parliament and \\noutlines the order of precedence to be observed in the National Assembly. The Article provides \\nas follows: \\n\\n108. \\n\\n(1) There shall be a leader of the majority party and a leader of the minority \\nparty. \\n(2) The leader of the majority party shall be the person who is the leader in \\nthe National Assembly of the largest party or coalition of parties. \\n(3) The leader of the minority party shall be the person who is the leader in \\nthe National Assembly of the second largest party or coalition of parties. \\n(4)  The  following  order  of  precedence  shall  be  observed  in  the  National \\nAssembly— \\n\\n(a) the Speaker of the National Assembly; \\n(b) the leader of the majority party; and, \\n(c) the leader of the minority party. \\n\\nHon. Members, what is clear from the Constitution is that the Leader of the Majority \\nParty must lead either a party or a coalition of parties in the National Assembly. I invite the \\nHouse  to  note  my  emphasis  on  the  word  ‘either’.  Article  92  of  the  Constitution  mandates \\nParliament to enact legislation on various aspects of political parties. To this end, the Political \\nParties Act, 2011 was enacted. This law has been amended several times, including as late as \\nFebruary  this  year.  You  will  note  that  section  2  of  the  Act  defines  a  political  party  as  an \\nassociation of citizens, with an identifiable ideology or programme, constituted for the purpose \\nof influencing public policy or nominating candidates to contest elections. The term is further \\ndefined to include a coalition political party. Under the same section, a coalition is defined as \\nan alliance of two or more political parties formed for the purpose of pursuing a common goal \\nand is governed by a written agreement that is deposited with the Registrar. On the other hand, \\na coalition political party is defined as a coalition that is registered by the Registrar as a political \\nparty.  Interestingly,  section  10(1)  of  the  Act  allows  two  or  more  political  parties  to  form  a \\ncoalition or a coalition political party before or after an election, on condition that they deposit \\na coalition agreement with the Registrar. \\n\\nWhat I discern from this definition in section 10(1) of the Act is that Parliament in its \\nwisdom  legislated  as  follows:  That  two  or  more  political  parties  may  form  a  coalition  or  a \\ncoalition party and deposit a written agreement with the Registrar. Further, that a coalition of \\ntwo or more parties may register itself as a political party with the Registrar under the Act.

Junet Mohamed, he submitted names of leaders representing the Azimio la Umoja - One \\nKenya  Coalition  Party.  Curiously,  in  the  same  letter,  the  Member  signed  off  as  Secretary-\\nGeneral of the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Coalition. This begs the question whether Azimio \\nla Umoja One Kenya Coalition is a coalition, a political party or both. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn the debate on this matter, several Members argued that a coalition political party is \\na perfectly legal vehicle that was used in the just-concluded elections to allow individual and \\ncorporate  membership  within  a  coalition.  In  my  understanding  of  Sections  2  and  10  of  the \\nPolitical  Parties  Act,  Parliament  permitted  a  coalition  political  party  to  elect  to  assume  the \\ncharacter of either a party or a coalition. In the last general election, it is evident that Azimio \\nla Umoja - One Kenya Coalition Party elected to behave as several political parties in certain \\ncategories of elections and as one political party with regard to the presidential election. It is \\nwithout doubt that if it were to be considered as a political party, Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya \\nCoalition Party has no elected Member in this House today, as no Member was elected under \\nits banner. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nThis is easily discernible from Gazette Notice No.9950 and Gazette Notice No.9951 of \\n2022, both dated 23rd August 2022, and Gazette Notice No.10535 dated 5th September 2022, \\nin which the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) declared the persons \\nduly  elected  as  Members  of  this  House  and  their  respective  political  parties.  Further,  it  is \\nnotable that with  respect to  Members nominated to  this House, the Azimio la Umoja  - One \\nKenya Coalition Party elected to nominate Members under the names of its constituent parties. \\nThis can be seen in Gazette Notice No.10537 of 2022 dated 7th September 2022 and Gazette \\nNotice  No.10710  of  2022  dated  9th  September  2022.  The  Azimio  la  Umoja-One  Kenya \\nCoalition  Party  seems  to  have  elected  to  enter  this  House  in  both  elective  and  nominative \\npositions through its individual constituent parties. It is a clear demonstration of the Coalition \\nParty’s  respect  for  freedom  of  association  under  Article  36  of  the  Constitution;  exercise  of \\npolitical rights under Article 38 of the Constitution and freedom of speech and debate in the \\nHouse under Article 117 of the Constitution.   \\nHon.  Members,  Article  108  of  the  Constitution  also  allows  a  coalition  to  elect  and \\n \\ndesignate their choice of the Leader of the Majority Party. The claim by the Kenya Kwanza \\nCoalition  is  based  under  this  limb.  Similarly,  the  Azimio  La  Umoja-One  Kenya  Coalition \\nPolitical  Party has staked its claim  to  the leadership  of the Majority  Party  in exercise of its \\nsecond skin as a coalition. \\n \\nWhat is clear from the Constitution is that the Leader of the Majority Party must lead \\neither a party or coalition of parties in the National Assembly, and not both. Indeed, as I noted \\nearlier  in  this  Communication,  in  determining  the  matter  confronting  the  House  today,  one \\nmust ask the question whether the entities claiming the leadership of the Majority Party are \\nparties or coalitions. The provision of the Constitution seems not to envisage the position of \\nthe Leader of the Majority Party being claimed by an entity that is both a party and a coalition \\nof parties. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The issue that arises at this stage is whether this conduct is in \\nconformity with the expectation of Article 108 of the Constitution, which requires an entity to \\nelect one of the two choices. \\nYou will recall that before the sine die adjournment of the 12th Parliament, the Standing \\n \\nOrders were amended to insert a new Standing Order 2B. This provision requires the Clerk of \\nthe  National  Assembly  to  obtain  a  certified  copy  of  any  coalition  agreement  entered  into \\nbetween two or more political parties. This amendment was necessitated by a dispute that arose \\nat the beginning of the 12th Parliament on the entitlement of the constituent parties of the then \\nNational  Super Alliance  Coalition, which is  commonly  referred to  as NASA Coalition, to a \\nshare in the membership of the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC). It was not possible \\nfor  the  then  Speaker  to  resolve  the  issue  without  access  to,  and  perusal  of  the  then  NASA \\nCoalition’s agreement that was deposited with the Registrar.  \\n \\nApart from resolving any disputes related to the membership of the PSC, it will interest \\nMembers to note that pursuant to Article 215(2) of the Constitution, part of the membership of \\nthe Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) is also drawn from nominees of the Majority \\nParty and Minority Parties in the House. This is the basis upon which the Standing Order was \\nintroduced in the last Parliament, so as to enable the Speaker to discern the undertakings made \\nby the parties with regard to the positions available to the House: the sharing of nominees for \\nappointment to Commissions such as the PSC and CRA, entitlement to positions in the East \\nAfrica Legislative Assembly (EALA) and, where necessary, determining the relative majorities \\nin the House. Journals of the House indicate that this provision was hardly intended to be used \\nto resolve questions of which party or coalition of parties has sufficient numbers in this House, \\nso as to be entitled to elect the Leader of the Majority Party.  \\n \\nHon. Members, the Political Parties Act provides a general framework for the formation \\nof coalitions, but leaves the substantive provisions to the formulation of the respective parties \\nto  a  coalition.  Where  the  substantive  provisions  of  a  coalition  agreement  are  unclear, \\nambiguous or are in contention, the interpretation of the intent of the parties is left to the general \\njurisdiction of the legal system. Nevertheless, perusal of an agreement entered into between the \\npartners  in  a  coalition  would  greatly  assist  in  resolving  or  forestalling  unnecessary  disputes \\nwhich are likely to impede the conduct of the business of the House. Indeed, upon obtaining a \\ncopy of the NASA Coalition Agreement, my immediate predecessor urged that the provision \\nof coalition agreements to the House should become standard practice. This is what informed \\nthe introduction of the new Standing Order 2B in our rules of procedure. \\nWith regard to the coalition agreements affecting the affairs of the 13th Parliament, the \\n \\nClerk wrote to the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties on 2nd September 2022. In her \\nletter  titled,  “Requests  for  Information  and  Copies  of  Coalition  Agreements  Pursuant  to  the \\nNational Assembly Standing Order 2B”, she provided the Registrar with a list of parties with \\nrepresentation in the House at the time. The Clerk sought the following from the Registrar:  \\n \\narrangements. Please include the date of the registration of the coalition(s); \\n \\nare in place and the dates of the changes, if any; and, \\n \\nlisted herein. \\nHon. Members, in response, the Registrar noted that as at 21st  April 2022, Azimio La \\n \\nUmoja-One Kenya Coalition Party comprised 26 political parties namely: Jubilee Party (JP), \\nOrange Democratic Movement (ODM), Wiper Democratic Movement of Kenya (WDM-K), \\n\\n(ii) Information on changes made to any of the coalition agreements or partnerships that \\n\\n(i) Guidance on which particular political parties (from the list above) are in Coalition \\n\\n(iii) Certified copies of the coalition arrangements entered into by any of the parties \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

These are the members of the Coalition as at 3rd June 2022.  \\n\\nCan the Members take their seats? \\n \\n\\n(Several Members walked into the Chamber) \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Members, the letter further notes that the Democratic Party, the National Agenda \\nParty of Kenya, the Grand Dream Development Party and Chama Cha Mashinani effectively \\nbecame members of the Coalition on 5th September 2022. The Registrar of Political Parties also \\nobserved that the National Ordinary People Empowerment Union (NOPEU) is not a member \\nof any of the coalitions. In the letter, the Registrar of Political  Parties also  conveys that the \\nMaendeleo  Chap  Chap  Party  (MCCM),  the  Pamoja  African  Alliance  (PAA),  the  United \\nDemocratic Movement (UDM) and the Movement for Democracy and Growth (MDG) have \\nfiled constitutional petitions and/or objections with regard to their membership of the Azimio \\nCoalition. \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nIt is notable that despite written requests by the Clerk of the National Assembly, the Registrar \\nof Political Parties did not convey certified copies of any pre-election or post-election coalition \\nagreements entered into by the parties with representation in this House in the response to the \\nletter dated 7th September 2022.  \\n\\nMay  I  at  this juncture report to  the House that surprisingly the Registrar of Political \\nParties today morning, at 8.30 a.m. submitted to me, through the Office of the Clerk, documents \\nsaid to be certified copies of the coalition agreements for the Kenya Kwanza Alliance Coalition \\nand the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Coalition Party. Curiously, whereas the Registrar’s letter \\nto the Clerk of the National Assembly is dated 3rd October 2022, the accompanying agreements \\nbear  a  certification  of  the  following  day,  which  is 4th October  2022.  The  letter  and  the \\ndocuments  were  delivered  to  the  Office  of  the  Clerk today,  6th October  2022.  That  is  more \\nthan six weeks after the request by the Clerk. Seemingly, this may be read by any reasonable \\nperson to be a reaction to the proceedings of the House on Tuesday, 4th October 2022. \\n\\nNevertheless, I have had occasion to peruse the documents accompanying the letter as \\nagainst the documents tabled in the House on Tuesday this week. Despite attempting to advise \\nthe House on the status of the coalition agreements affecting the composition of the House as \\nat 3rd October 2022, the Registrar has again failed to mention the existence of any post-election \\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.  A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n6th October 2022                  NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                   23 \\n\\n \\ncoalition  agreements.  This  is  a  glaring  omission  when  viewed  against  the  post-election \\ncoalition agreements tabled by the Member for Kikuyu Constituency during the proceedings. \\nThe post-election coalition agreements are critical to the Speaker for purposes of guaranteeing \\nconstitutional  rights  and  political  freedoms  of  Members  of  this  House  elected  under  UDM, \\nPAA, MCCP and MDG. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nThis  now  brings  me  to  the  submissions  made  by  Hon.  Opiyo  Wandayi  on  the \\nsignificance to be attached to the response of the Registrar of Political Parties, which he also \\ntabled  in  the  House  on  Tuesday  this  week  and  any  subsequent  communication  from  the \\nRegistrar.   It  will  be  recalled  that  the  distinguished  Member  for  Ugunja  submitted  that the \\nSpeaker  has  no  other  role  apart  from  conveying  information  contained  in  the  letter  by  the \\nRegistrar to the House. You will agree with me that this view is untenable for two main reasons. \\n Firstly, Section 10 of the Political Parties Act 2011 is clear that coalitions are not cast \\nin stone. They are evolving arrangements that can occur both prior to and after an election. The \\nRegistrar  has  shied  away  from  making  a  determination  on  the  post-election  status  of  the \\nexisting coalitions in light of the submissions made by part of the membership of this House \\nand  letters  written  to  me  by  a  number  of  Members  relating  to  post-election  coalitions.  The \\nSpeaker ought not to be a conduit for this indecision in so far as it has the potential of curtailing \\nthe business of the House that is an important constitutional arm of the national Government. \\nSecondly, you will also agree with me that the assertion by the Hon. Member for Ugunja is \\nflawed  on  account  of  the  history  I  have  given  to  the  House  relating  to  the  rationale  of \\nintroducing  Standing  Order  2B.  It  is,  indeed,  an  established  parliamentary  practice  that  the \\nSpeaker is not a mere conveyor belt of information. The Speaker must apply his mind to any \\ncommunication  or  document  before  it  is  presented  to  the  House  or  admitted  for  use  in  the \\nHouse. This  is  important in  order to  comply  with  the Standing  Orders of  this House and to \\nprotect the dignity of the House. \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nIn  the  present  instance,  Standing  Order  2B  expressly  requires  the  Clerk  to  obtain  a \\ncertified  copy  of  any  coalition  agreement  to  assist  the  Speaker  to  ascertain  the  relative \\nmajorities of the House and facilitate transaction business of the House. Certification of the \\ndocument and determination of its veracity and admissibility is of prime importance. You will \\nagree with me again that there would be chaos in this House if I made rulings on the basis of \\nan  unauthenticated,  unverifiable  and  inadmissible  document  that  affects  the  rights  of \\nMembers.  \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nI note that unless the Political Parties Act is amended or the House exercises its power \\nto  call  for  evidence  under  Article  125  of  the  Constitution, there  currently  exists  no  express \\nstatutory  obligation  to  the Registrar  to  furnish  the  House  with  coalition  agreements  as \\ncontemplated  under  Standing  Order  2B.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  12th Parliament  noted  this \\nparticular  gap  and  proposed  amendments  to  the  Political  Parties  Act  whose  introduction  I \\napproved in my Communication issued during the Afternoon Sitting of Tuesday, 4th October \\n2022. Those Members of Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) have a job to do to cure \\nthis lacuna. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

You will recall that I ruled the documents \\ntabled by Hon. Junet Mohamed as inadmissible owing to the inconsistencies that were apparent \\non  the  face  of  the  document.  The  inconsistencies  were  glaring,  especially  in  light  of  the \\nallegations made by Hon. David Ochieng denouncing association of both himself and his party \\nwith  the  Azimio  Coalition  Political  Party.  Apart  from  being  a  Member  of  this  House,  Hon. \\nDavid Ochieng is also the party leader of the MDG, an alleged party in the document tabled by \\nHon. Junet Mohamed. \\n\\nIn light of the objections raised by Hon. David Ochieng, the document became a centre \\nof particular focus with respect to its legality, validity and admissibility. The attempt by the \\nRegistrar  of  Political  Parties  to  convey  what  is  said  to  be  a  certified  copy  of  the  document \\ntabled  by  Hon.  Junet  Mohamed  on  6th October  2022  has  not  made  things  any  better.  The \\ndocument from the Registrar, just like the document tabled by Hon. Junet Mohamed, has the \\nsame glaring gaps and inconsistencies that make it inadmissible. \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nMy predecessors have severally addressed the question of admissibility of Papers laid \\nin  this  House.  In  the  most  recent  case,  Hon.  Justin  Muturi  distilled  previous  guidance  on \\nadmissibility  of  documents  into  nine  brief  rules  in  a  Communication  issued  on  Tuesday, \\n10th May 2022 while ruling on the tabling of Papers by the then Member for Wajir County, \\nHon.  Fatuma  Gedi.  The  then  Speaker  ruled  that  in  assessing  the  admissibility  and/or \\nauthenticity or otherwise of a document tabled in the House, the Speaker  ought  to  examine \\nwhether the document:  \\n\\n(i) \\n(ii) \\n\\nrelates to the matter for which it has been tabled; \\nis signed, and if it is a Government document, by the authorised person or \\npersons; \\n\\n(iii)  bears the emblem or logo of the institution/person from which it originated \\n\\nor coat of arms in the case of documents from Government agencies; \\n\\n(iv)  clearly indicates the author and person to whom it is addressed; \\n(v)  discloses the origin or source of the document; \\n(vi)  bears certification where a document other than the original is being tabled; \\n(vii)  if electronic, has been obtained from a source that does not permit alteration \\n\\nof contents; \\n\\n(viii) is related to a claim made before the House or a Committee or its content \\n\\nhas a nexus with the claim; and \\nis stamped and clearly indicates the person signing off the stamp. \\n\\n(ix) \\n\\nCan the Hon. Members take their seats? \\n\\n(Several Members walked into the Chamber) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nHon.  Members,  a  perusal  of  the  document  tabled  by  Hon.  Junet  Mohamed  and  the \\nversion conveyed by the Registrar of Political Parties reveals glaring inconsistencies in both \\ndocuments. With regard to signatures, there is no uniformity in the manner in which the various \\npages of the documents have been signed off, or initialed. Some pages in the documents contain \\nfewer signatures than others while Page 3 of both documents, in particular, contain signatures \\nthat are hardly visible. The pagination of the two documents is also inconsistent. Pages 1 to 22 \\nbear page numbers; several pages with signatures bear no page numbers; and a paginated page \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

I  am  inclined  to  think  that  these  are \\nsuperimpositions.  \\n\\nHon.  Members,  may  I  at  this  point  bring  to  the  attention  of  the  House  that  several \\nMembers said to belong to the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Coalition Party have formally \\nwritten to my office to denounce their association with the party. In a letter dated 9th September \\n2022  and  received  by  my  office  on  22nd  September  2022,  the  Member  for  Ugenya \\nConstituency,  Hon.  David  Ochieng  wrote  to  convey  the  decision  of  his  party,  the  MDG  to \\nterminate its membership with the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Coalition Party. In the letter, \\nHon. Ochieng also notes that his party is now a member of the Kenya Kwanza Coalition.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nIn letters received by my office on 21st and 22nd September 2022, Hon. Kenneth Charo, Hon. \\nGonzi  Rai  and Hon. Anthony Kenga, who were  all elected to  Parliament on the PAA Party \\nticket  formally  distanced  themselves  and  their  party  from  any  association  with  the  Azimio \\nCoalition.  The  three  categorically  noted  that  their  party  should  only  be  associated  with  the \\nKenya Kwanza Coalition with which it has entered into its only existing coalition agreement.  \\n \\n\\n \\nAdditionally, in a letter dated 16th September 2022 and received by my office on 19th September \\n2022, all the seven Members of Parliament elected to the National Assembly under the United \\nDemocratic  Movement  (UDM),  namely  Hon.  Maj  (Rtd).  Bashir  Abdullahi,  Hon.  Hassan \\nKulow, Hon. Haro Abdul Ebrahim, Hon. Mangale Chiforomodo, Hon. Yusuf Adan Haji, Hon. \\nJoseph Lekuton, Hon. Umul Kheir Kassim and Hon. Sulekha Harun distanced themselves and \\ntheir party from any alleged coalition agreement with the Azimio Coalition.  \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nInstead, they note in their letter that they are party to a post-election coalition agreement with \\nthe Kenya Kwanza Coalition. It is their contention that their affiliation with the Kenya Kwanza \\nCoalition has seemingly been ignored by the Registrar of Political Parties.  \\n\\nIt  will  be  recalled  that  during  the  debate  on  this  matter  on  Tuesday  this  week,  Hon. \\nDavid Ochieng; Hon. Kassait Kamket; Hon. Mwengi Mutuse; Hon. Bashir Abdullahi and Hon. \\nKenneth Charo also raised serious concerns as to the membership of the MDG; KANU; MCCP; \\nUDM and PAA in the Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Coalition Party. At this stage, the question \\nthat comes to my mind as your Speaker is, what am I meant to do with these contentions?  \\n\\nAllegations were also made by a number of Members on alleged coercion and duress \\n\\nwhile entering into agreements with one of the coalitions.  \\n \\n\\n \\nOrder, Hon. Members! I have not finished what I am saying.  \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThis, if true, is a serious affront to the democratic rights and freedoms that we enjoy as \\ncitizens of this country. As a seasoned lawmaker and a lawyer, I note that the political freedoms \\ngranted to Kenyans by the Bill of Rights must be taken very seriously in the affairs of political \\nparties.  If  I were to  rely on the coalition agreements  tabled before this House,  I would find \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Our \\nConstitution is very Rights-centric. In any ruling I make as your Speaker, I must be guided by \\nthe  provisions  of  Article  3;  Article  10  and  Article  21  of  the  Constitution.  These  provisions \\nrequire me to uphold, respect and defend the Constitution whenever applying myself on any \\nquestions brought before me. I am also under an obligation to jealously protect the rights and \\nfreedoms guaranteed by the Constitution to all Members of this House and indeed all Kenyans. \\nYou  will  note that  even when  making  laws,  all  of  you  are  enjoined  under  Article  24  of  the \\nConstitution to ensure that any limits you place on a right or freedom are expressly stated and \\nthat the limitation is reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society.  \\n\\nHaving  looked  at  the  drafting  style  of  the  Political  Parties  Act,  vis-à-vis  the \\nrequirements of Article 24(2) of the Constitution, it is evident that the Political Parties Act does \\nnot manifest or declare any intent whatsoever to limit the rights guaranteed under Article 36 of \\nthe Constitution on the freedom of association and Article 38 of the Constitution on political \\nrights. Political rights are not absolute. They may be limited in a manner that is consistent with \\nthe  provisions  of  Article  24  of  the  Constitution.  Indeed,  the  Political  Parties  Act  does  not \\nengage in  the substantive limitation  of rights  but only deals  with  the procedural  exercise of \\nthose rights in terms of timelines. Indeed, the architecture of the Act is that timelines are only \\nprescribed with respect to activities that fall before the election date which seem to be related \\nto  the  management  of  the  election  calendar.  There  are  no  timelines  prescribed  for  activities \\nafter the election date. From the provisions of the Act, it appears that a person is at liberty to \\njoin and leave political parties as long as they notify the Registrar of their actions.  \\n\\nI am not sure whether a provision of a coalition agreement regulating the period within \\nwhich a Member may exit a coalition would pass the test of being compliant with the Political \\nParties Act, in the first instance, or the Constitution, in the second instance.  Fortunately, that \\nis not for me to decide. I trust those who are aggrieved will find their way to courts of law in \\nexercise of their powers under Article 165 of the Constitution. Noting that some of the matters \\nraised were said to be pending either in the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal or the court, I \\nshall refrain from pronouncing myself on such. \\n\\nHon. Members, let me now turn to the nexus between the letter from the Registrar of \\nPolitical  Parties  and  the  several  gazette  notices  published  by  the  Independent  Electoral  and \\nBoundaries Commission (IEBC) with respect to your election or nomination as Members of \\nthis House. Based on Gazette Notices No. 9950 and 9951 of 2022 both dated 23rd August 2022; \\nGazette Notice No. 10535 of 2022 dated 5th September 2022; Gazette  Notice No. 10537 of \\n2022 dated 7th September 2022 and Gazette Notice No. 10710 of 2022 dated 9th September \\n2022  the  current  composition  of  the  National  Assembly  by  individual  political  parties  is  as \\nfollows: The UDA), 145; ODM, 86; Jubilee Party, 28; WDM, 26; UDM, 8; ANC, 8; FORD-\\nK, 6; KANU, 6; DAP-K, 5; PAA, 3; KUP, 3; UPIA 2; MCCP, 2; TSP, 2; UPA, 1; NAP-K, 1; \\nNOPEU, 1; GDDP, 1; DP, 1; MDG)1; and CCM, 1. \\n\\nHon. Members, reference to the letter by the Registrar of Political Parties would give \\nthe cumulative number of members of the constituent parties of what the Registrar refers to \\nas the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Coalition Party as 171 Members against 165 Members \\nof the constituent parties of what the Registrar refers to as the Kenya Kwanza Alliance. It is \\nhowever,  notable  that  a  total  of  14  Members  are  drawn  from  four  parties  which  is  UDM, \\nMDG, MCCP and PAA who according to the letter of the Registrar have filed constitutional \\npetitions and objections against their membership in Azimio. This implies that the letter from \\nthe Registrar may not be used to compute the membership of the Majority and Minority parties \\nby dint of the admission contained in it on the existing constitutional petitions and objections. \\nHon. Members, it will also be recalled that the Members of UDM, MDG, MCCP and \\nPAA have claimed they signed pre-election and post-election coalition agreements with the \\nKenya Kwanza Alliance Coalition. Cumulatively, the membership of the four parties in this \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

If these Members were to be added to the 165 Members of the initial \\nconstituent parties of the Kenya Kwanza Coalition, it would comprise a total of 179 Members. \\n\\n \\n\\nConsequently, the Azimio Coalition would then… \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\nI have not finished this ruling at all. Order, Members. If you listen… \\n \\n\\n \\nHon. Mbadi, I am sure you know the difference between if and when. Consequently, \\nthe Azimio Coalition would then comprise a total of 157 Members. However, the pending \\nconstitutional cases and objections by Members of UDM, MDG, MCCP and PAA noted by \\nthe  Registrar  of  Political  Parties,  in  addition  to  the  letters  sent  by  the  Members  and  the \\ncontentions recorded during Tuesday’s Sitting have a profound bearing on the matter at hand \\nin so far as the same relates to the business of the House. \\n\\nAt  this  stage,  the  House  has  a  choice  to  either  halt  its  proceedings  and  await  the \\ndetermination of matters that are before the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal and the courts \\nor to permit the Speaker to make a decision that facilitates this House to continue discharging \\nits constitutional functions. \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nOrder! You will hear the Speaker in silence. In any event, Members are aware that the \\nsub judice rule is a rule that the House imposes on itself. It can never be contemplated that \\nthe House can curtail the performance of its own mandate.  \\n \\n\\nCan the Hon. Members at the Bar take their seats?  \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n (Several Members walked into the Chamber) \\n\\nHon. Member, take your seats. This includes among others, the formation of not only \\nthe  House  Business  Committee,  but  also  other  key  Committees  of  the  House  whose \\nmembership must be appointed within a prescribed timeline of seven days and others that are \\nextremely critical to the functioning of this House and the national Government. \\n\\nThe Committees that ought to be constituted within seven days include the following: \\n1.  The House Business Committee which determines, prioritises and approves \\n\\nthe business to be considered by this House under Standing Order No.171; \\n\\n2.  The Committee on Selection which is responsible for nominating Members \\n\\nto serve in Committees under Standing Order 172; \\n\\n3.  The Committee on Appointments which is responsible for vetting of persons \\nnominated  to  serve  as  Cabinet  Secretaries  under  Article  152(2)  of  the \\nConstitution; \\n\\n4.  The  Budget  and  Appropriations  Committee  which  is  responsible  for \\n\\nconsideration of the Budget Estimates; and \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

The  National  Government  Constituencies  Development  Fund  Committee \\nwhich  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the  policy  and  legislative  framework \\nmatters relating to the NG-CDF. This is especially important noting the need \\nfor a forum to deliberate some current matters that you are all fully aware of. \\nHon. Members, the disclosure by the Registrar relating to the petitions and objections, \\nthe letters by the Members of the four parties, the oral objections raised in this House, and the \\nneed to promote the continuity of the business of the House while respecting the due process \\nof  the  courts  of  law,  presents  this  House  with  a  complex  situation  that  requires  balanced \\nconsideration of the intent and philosophy behind the provisions of Articles 108 and 124 of the \\nConstitution. \\n\\n In  determining  this  delicate  balance  between  the  provision  that  establishes  the \\nleadership positions of the House, and the provision which empowers this House to make its \\nown rules of procedure, due regard must be given to Article 3 of the Constitution which requires \\nall persons to protect, defend and uphold the Constitution and Article 10 of the Constitution \\nwhich requires one to apply the national values and principles of governance when interpreting \\nthe Constitution. \\n\\nHon. Members, I note that the four parties which I mentioned cumulatively, comprise \\nof 14 Members. The Members elected to this House under the four parties have exercised their \\nfreedom of association under Article 36 of the Constitution. They have already migrated to the \\nKenya Kwanza Alliance both in writing and in action. The parties are already enjoying benefits \\naccruing  from  their  membership  of  the  Kenya  Kwanza  Coalition  based  on  the  coalition \\nagreements that they signed and deposited with the Registrar. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n Indeed, and as noted earlier, the 14 Members have written to me distancing themselves and \\ntheir parties from the Azimio Coalition and have called upon Hon. Speaker to recognise their \\ncoalition agreement with Kenya Kwanza with respect to the business of this House. I also noted \\nthe verbal representation made by some of the 14 Members during the debate on this matter on \\nTuesday, 4th October 2022. \\n\\n Hon. Members, I started by noting the sentiments by Hon. John Mbadi on the fact that \\nthe  Members  comprising  the  leadership  of  the  Kenya  Kwanza  Coalition  and  the  Azimio  la \\nUmoja-One  Kenya  Coalition  Party  was  not  in  contention.  Indeed,  no  objection  was  raised \\nduring the debate on the issue of either proposing an alternate line up or the allusion to the \\nexistence of any other coalition comprising any parties with representation in this House. \\n\\nHaving addressed the question of who between the Kenya Kwanza Coalition and the \\nAzimio la Umoja-One Kenya Coalition is entitled to appoint the Leader of the Majority Party, \\nallow me to discharge my responsibilities under Standing Order 19A(4) and 20(4) with respect \\nto the leadership of the House in the 13th Parliament. \\n\\nHon. Members allow me now to address the House on the fate of the letters received \\nfrom Hon. Jeremiah Kioni, the Secretary General of the Jubilee Party, which I mentioned in \\nmy Communication on Tuesday, 4th October, 2022. The Jubilee Party, and indeed, any other \\nparliamentary party is at liberty to designate its party leaders and whips by dint of the provisions \\nof  Standing  Order  20A  which  provides  for  the  recognition  of  parliamentary  parties. \\nSpecifically, the Standing Order provides that a parliamentary party has the right to designate \\na leader and Whip of the party in the House for purposes of the transaction of the business of \\nthe  House.  However,  in  parliamentary  practice,  the  House  frowns  upon  any  purported \\ncommunication emanating from “strangers” especially if the matter relates to the internal \\norganization of sections within the House. This is intended to ensure that the House only \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

For \\nclarity, Standing Order 20A (3) provides, and I quote: \\n\\n3.  The  names  of  the  Members  designated  as  party  whips  shall  be \\n\\ncommunicated to the Speaker in writing by: \\n\\na)  the Leader of the Majority Party on behalf of the Majority Party; \\nb)  the Leader of the Minority Party on behalf of the Minority Party; \\n\\nor \\n\\nc)  the leader of a parliamentary party in the National Assembly in \\ncase of a parliamentary party that is not part of a coalition forming \\nthe Majority Party or the Minority Party.” \\n\\nIn  order  to  facilitate  the  transaction  of  the  business  of  the  House  the  Leader  of  the \\nMajority Party and the Leader of the Minority Party are required to forward to me the names \\nof Members who shall sit in the five critical committees that I mentioned earlier. \\n\\nHon.  Members,  Standing  Order  171(1)(f)  provides  that,  apart  from  the  House \\nleadership, the House Business Committee consists of nine other Members nominated by the \\nparliamentary  parties,  reflecting  the  relative  majorities  and  taking  into  consideration  the \\ninterests of parties other than parliamentary parties and independents. \\n \\nFurthermore, Standing Order 172(1)(c) provides that besides the House leadership, the \\nCommittee on Selection consists of not less than 11 and not more than 21 Members nominated \\nby the parliamentary parties reflecting the relative majorities and taking into consideration the \\ninterests of parties other than parliamentary parties and independents. \\n\\nStanding Order 204(1) provides that apart from the leadership of the House, Committee \\non  Appointments  consists  of  not  more  than  15  other  Members  nominated  by  the  House \\nBusiness Committee on the basis of proportional party membership taking into consideration \\nthe numerical strength of the parties and interests of independents. \\n\\nHon. Members, upon formation of the Committee on Selection, I will be asking the \\nparty  leadership  to  nominate  Members  for  appointment  to  the  rest  of  the  committees  with \\nparticular priority to the Budget and Appropriations Committee and the National Government \\nConstituency Development Fund Committee. It is imperative that in nominating the Members \\nto  the  Committees,  Majority  and  Minority  Leaders  should  as  much  as  possible  take  into \\nconsideration  the  gender  representation,  the  need  for  regional  balance  and  the  interests  of \\nparties other than parliamentary parties and indeed the Independents. \\n\\nAs to the completeness of the membership of the aforementioned committees, you \\nwill note that I have reserved some slots for Independent Members in each of the three \\nCommittees  whose  nomination  ratios  I  have  specified.  This  is  to  ensure  adherence  to  the \\nStanding Orders which require the recognition of the various shades of opinion represented \\nin the House. As my predecessor noted during the 12th Parliament, “the Speaker should protect \\nthe  Independent  Members  and  small  parties  in  the  nomination  to  and  discharge  from \\ncommittees.” \\n\\nHon. Members in summary therefore, my considered determination on the matter \\n\\nraised is as follows: \\n\\n1.  THAT, consideration of the various allegations of coercion and duress at the time \\nof entering into coalition agreements and any appropriate remedy for the same lies \\noutside the authority of this House. \\n\\n2.  THAT, in my considered opinion, it would be imprudent to treat the 14 Members \\nelected to the House under the UDM, PAA, MCCP and MDG as part of a coalition \\nthat  they  have  expressly  distanced  both  themselves  and  their  parties  from.  I  am \\ntherefore persuaded that the 14 Members and their parties are part  of the Kenya \\nKwanza Coalition. This, in my view, would be fair and in accordance with previous \\nrulings by my predecessors on related matters. \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

THAT, pursuant to Standing Order 259, the marked seats in the front row of the \\nChamber  to  my  right  and  to  my  left  are  reserved  for  the  persons  occupying  the \\noffices of leadership of the Majority Party  and leadership of the Minority Party, \\nrespectively. \\n\\n15. THAT,  in  accordance  with  Article  108  of  the  Constitution,  the  Parliamentary \\nService Act, 2019 and Standing Order 19, the Clerk of the National Assembly is \\nhereby directed to take necessary measures to facilitate the leadership of the House \\nthat has been appointed to move into their respective offices and access all other \\nentitlements  relating  to  their  offices  as  has  been  approved  by  the  Salaries  and \\nRemuneration Commission (SRC) and the Parliamentary Service Commission.  \\n\\nIn conclusion, Hon. Members, today’s guidance has been informed by my solemn duty \\nto facilitate the continuity of the business of this House. The House would be at a standstill \\nwithout a clear guidance on the leadership of the House. It is so directed. \\n\\nWe now go back to the debate on the Presidential Address.  \\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nHon. Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja, ODM): On a point of order, Hon. Speaker. \\nHon. Speaker: Yes, Hon. Wandayi. \\nHon. Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja, ODM): Hon. Speaker, I listened keenly to your ruling \\non  this  contentious  issue.  Whereas,  of  course,  I  do  not  agree  with  it,  I  would  wish  to \\nacknowledge the fact  that this House operates in  a quasi-judicial manner.  Therefore, in  line \\nwith rules of natural justice, tenets of democracy and established jurisprudence, I would wish \\nto give notice that we shall be moving you to review your decision. For that reason, I will be \\nasking you to give me an opportunity to make certain submissions or to make an application \\nfor  you  to  review  your  decision.  My  application  is,  obviously,  in  line  with  established \\njurisprudential practice. Again, I will be asking you to direct the Clerk to facilitate my coalition \\nwith certified copies of your ruling, if possible by close of business today. \\n \\nHon. Speaker, I say this with tremendous respect to your office and to the institution of \\nParliament.  It  is  important  for  us  to  establish  a  culture  of  openness  and  transparency  and, \\nindeed, to work consciously towards entrenching democracy and the rule of law. So, I will be \\nasking you to allow me to formally make that application at the earliest possible opportunity. I \\nam seeking leave. \\n\\nHon. Speaker: Order, Hon. Members. In the tradition of the House, under our Standing \\nOrders and practice, once the Speaker makes a ruling such as the one I have made, it is not \\nsubject to debate, it is not appealable and it stands as it is. I want to take this opportunity to \\nsalute and thank you, Hon. Wandayi and all Members of the House, for the decorum that you \\nhave exhibited throughout the close to one hour that I delivered the ruling. \\n\\n \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\n \\nDisclaimer:  The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information purposes \\nonly.

Let the chips fall \\nwhere  they  may.  Take  up  your  offices.  Carry  out  a  robust  and  vibrant  oversight  of  the \\nGovernment and make sure that public resources from taxpayers are put to good use. Audit \\ntheir use vigorously and make sure that you do everything possible within the law to ensure \\nthat we have  a responsible Parliament, with both  sides being responsive to  the needs of the \\npeople of Kenya. \\n\\nThere will be no further debate on this matter. You know the rules. You are all very \\nsenior Members. And the new colleagues who have come in want to learn from you. Do not \\ngive them misdirection on procedure. I now want us to go to the Order that we had suspended \\nto take the ruling. I will give the Floor to Hon. Abdikadir Mohamed of Lagdera.  \\n \\n\\n(Several Members rose in their places) \\n\\nOn the same matter?  \\nHon. Members: Yes. \\n \\n\\n(Loud consultations) \\n\\n \\nHon. Speaker: Order, Hon. Members! Order, Hon. Junet! I have given direction. The \\nruling of the Speaker is a public document; it will be on the parliamentary website. You can \\nget it in the course of the evening or tomorrow, depending on what the Clerks-at-the-Table will \\ndo, and you can analyse it and critique it. You can do many things about it except debate it on \\nthe Floor of this House.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Laughter) \\n\\n(Applause) \\n\\nI  indulged  the  distinguished  Member  for  Ugunja,  being  your  leader,  to  make  a \\ncomment, which he did and we have taken it in the stride. I have given him direction and you \\ncan see how distinguished he is with respect to what I have said. I want to urge you to remember \\nthat we have  called out  the order which we suspended before the ruling.  If the Member  for \\nLagdera is on the Floor, he can continue with debate. If he is not, we can give the Floor to the \\nnext Member.  \\n\\n \\n\\nHon. Members: He is here. \\nHon. Speaker: Go on, Member. \\nHon. Abdikadir Mohamed (Lagdera, ODM): Thank you, Hon. Speaker.  \\nHon. Members: No! No! \\nHon. Speaker: Member for Lagdera, if you want to cede your time, we can give it to \\nsomebody else. Order, Hon. Members! Order! Order! Order, Hon. Members! The Member for \\nLagdera, you will forfeit your position if you do not want to speak. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(Several Members congregated around the Mace) \\n\\n \\n\\n Order, Hon. Members!
